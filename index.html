        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a self taught developer with more than two years of experience and have embarked on a journey of continuous learning and growth in the field of Software Development.

            Over the past few years I have explored various programming languages and tools. Through practice, projects and hands-on-experience I have gained a good proficiency in writing code, debugging issues and solving problems. I have delved into Web Development, creating websites and Web Applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and also using framework like React JS. 
            
            I am currently seeking new opportunities to apply and further develop my skills as a developer. If you are looking for a dedicated and self motivated developer, I would love to connect and explore how I can add value to your team or project.</p>
